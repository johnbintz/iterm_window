# iTermWindow

*Make iTerm obey your command! Start up your complex development environment quickly and easily.*

The typical Rails project requires three or tour terminal windows/tabs open at once:

* The Rails app itself running using `rails s`
* Two continuous testing environments, powered by Guard or Autotest, running on your Ruby and JavaScript code
* A console ready for committing code or other maintenance tasks
* A log file or two
